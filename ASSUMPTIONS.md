# ASSUMPTIONS

## Program structure

The program should be able to:
    - `load and parse different input data files`, so that it can be used outside of the scope of this project and tested arbitrarily.
    - `have predefined set of "strategies"`, so that they can be evaluated on different files.
       NOTE: `strategy` will be an implementation of the traversal algorithm.
        Initially Depth-first Search (`DFS`) will be considered. An placeholder `Optimized` will be defined and worked on after the initial skeleton is implemented. 
    - `perform different calculations based on an argument`, so that we can abstract away the traversal of the triangles from the computing function.
       NOTE: we will define `min` and `max` operations just as illustrative example

The program should be testable for any provided set of parameters.
